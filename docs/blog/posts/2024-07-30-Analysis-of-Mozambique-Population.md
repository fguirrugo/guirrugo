I'm excited to share another analysis, this time looking at the population distribution of our vast and beautiful Mozambique.

This analysis was made possible through the rasterised administrative units used to carry out the population breakdown, with a spatial resolution of approximately 100m grid cells (0.0008333 decimal degrees). The estimate was made for the year 2022 and different manifestations of the spatial distribution of the population are illustrated for each city throughout the country. With this analysis, it was possible to identify the most populous zones according to the occupational groups in each focus zone.
